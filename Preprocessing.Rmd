```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
require("summarytools")
data <- read.csv("./Bank.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ";")
```

## Raw Dataset

```{r data, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
print(dfSummary(data, plain.ascii = FALSE, style = "grid", graph.magnif = 0.8, tmp.img.dir = "/tmp"))
#print(dfSummary(data, plain.ascii = FALSE, style = "grid"))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#plot(data)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
